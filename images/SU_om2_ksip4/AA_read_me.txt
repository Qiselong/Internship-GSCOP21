Randomly generated US graphs. 
About the naming convention...:

	- natgraph_xxx.png: 		'natural graphs'; no particular treatment
	- puregraph_xxx.png: 		removed vertices of degree 1 + coloration regarding the degree.
	- graph_minus2_xxx.png: 	I was trying to remove vertices of d2 that have a neighbour of d2. It was not working well (observe for instance graph_minus2_37.png) for some reason. Some appears empty; which is a special case where the algorithm was able to remove every vertex.
