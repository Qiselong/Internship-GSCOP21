These images are the product of an algorithm that finds 3-regular graphs of size 8. 
It is likely that the algorithm can be modified easily to look for graphs of bigger size that share this property. 
It worked by exploring every possible outcome of such graphs. However, it was too difficult to determine if two graphs where the same or not (for instance by switching the names of some vertices). That had to be done "by hand", which is why the names of the files does not follow some logical rule. Before deleting the graphs that were identical, they were about 50 of them.
