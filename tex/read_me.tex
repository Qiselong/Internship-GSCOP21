1:                  is about super vertex coloring. (it was the first i wrote, so very poor naming convention i admitt)
any_tree_is_US:     is about a proof for the fact not every tree can be US. I intented to write it completely then quickly realized it was not necessary to go too much into details.
counterexample:     is about the cube graph + 1 vertex. There is a proof for the fact it is not unit square, as well as some thoughts on the grid graphs.
cubics_1:           is about grid graphs. There are some early results we had on them, so some things may be false, and we end up doing some in other ways.
MM_IG:              is about maximum matching algorithm.
on_a_grid:          early version of cubics_1
