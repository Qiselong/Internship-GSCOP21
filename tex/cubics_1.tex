Let $G:= (V, E)$ be a bridgless undirected cubic planar graph.
\begin{lemma}
    If $G$ is cubic, then $|V|$ is even.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    $2|E| = \sum_{v \in V} d(v) = 3|V| $ \\
    As $|E|$ must be integer, it follows that we must be able o divide $|V|$ by 2.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    If $G$ is cubic, planar and bridgless, then $G$ has a chromatic index of 3. 
\end{lemma}


Consider the graph $G':= (V', E')$, obtained from $G$ by removing an edge $xy$, adding a vertex $z$, and adding edges $xz$ and $yz$. 
\begin{lemma}
    $G'$ has a chromatic index of 4.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    As $\Delta(G') = 3$; we prove the $\chi'(G') \le 4$ thanks to Vizing's theorem.\\
    Now consider a matching $M$ of the edges of $E'$. as $|V'| = |V|+1$ is odd, each matching can cover at most $|V|$ vertices,
    so it can at most contains $\dfrac{|V|}{2}$ edges. However, we have $|E'| = \dfrac{3}{2} |V| + 1$ edges, so we must have $\chi'(G') \ge 4$.
\end{proof}
