#SECTION 2

#goal of this section is to write a script to count how much
# k-regular graphs of size nV are acceptable. 

#the idea is to represent a graph as an upper triangle matrix of size
# nV, nV. A case is a number in binary of size 2^(nV-1)
# a function verifies that the case is conform:
# enough edges on each line, etc.

#TODO Let A be the adjacency matrix of a graph. Then the graph is regular if and only if j = ( 1 , â€¦ , 1 ) {\displaystyle {\textbf {j}}=(1,\dots ,1)} {\textbf {j}}=(1,\dots ,1) is an eigenvector of A.
